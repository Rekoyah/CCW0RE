        <h1>First Week Coding Terms</h1>
        <h2>Computer</h2>
        <p1>Before it referred to mechanical machines, the word "computer"
            was described as a human who performed calculations or
            computations. It was first used in the 1613 book The Yong 
            Mans Gleanings by Richard Braithwaite. By the end of the 
            ninteenth century, "computer" was even an official job title. 
            In honor of Black History Month, Katherine Johnson, for example,
            worked for NASA as a computer. She is widely known for being the 
            only one Alan Shepard, the first American astronaut, trusted to 
            calculate the trajectory for his May 1961 mission Freedom 7.

        <h2>Difference Engine</h2>
        <p2>The Difference Engine is the first automatic computing machine to 
            calculate polynomials. The D.E. was capable of not only computing
            several sets of numbers but also providing hard copies of the results. 
            It was conceptualized and began development in 1822 by Charles Babbage.
            Furthermore, Ada Lovelace was considered the first computer programmer
            for her work on developing the D.E. along with Babbage. Unfortunately 
            though, Babbage never completed a full-scale functional version of the 
            D.E. due to lack of funding. Honoring his contribution, the London Science
            Museum completed the Difference Engine No. 2 for the bicentennial year of 
            Babbage's birth in June 1991 and later completed the printing mechanism in 
            2000.
